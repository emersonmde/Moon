# HackerRank

About a year ago, while looking for resources to learn Java, I stumbled on HackerRank. This opened up the world of 
programming challenges and coding practice I had never known about. In the past, Although the concept isn't new to 
me, I've found the sites that provide simple tasks to test your skills and an objective ranking mechanism incredibly 
useful.

### 10 Days of Statistics

It has been almost 10 years since my last formal statistics class. Although my job involves using a lot of 
statistics, mostly its done through tools or libraries that are black boxes that output the answers I'm looking for. 
I'm sure there has been so much content I have forgotten in the intermediate years. Once I saw the 10 Days of 
Statistics challenges on HackerRank, I was hooked.

so far it's been invaluable. Not only does it explain fundamental concepts well, it forces you to implement that 
concept in code. I've been able to take a lot of these concepts I've re-learned and apply it directly to my 
professional work.

### Python

Since I have moved into my current job about a year and a half ago, I have moved from writing most of my projects in 
Python to writing in Ruby. I recently tried to create a lambda function in Python, and realized just how much I had 
forgotten. Because of this realization, I started creating small programming challenges for myself. Some of which 
were becoming much more complex then they needed to be.

That's where HackerRank comes in. So far it seems to be a perfect place to practice these skills in a quick and 
objective way. A lot of the Python practices on HackerRank seems really interesting and helpful. I've even fallen 
into the trap of trying to get the gold badge for Python!

## Conclusion

I'm excited to check out more of these sites. However there do seem to be a few downsides. By doing these challenges 
in the online IDE, there seems to be a tendency to use as many shortcuts as possible. This includes, monolithic code,
 poor naming conventions, and lack of reusability. Also all of this code is split into separate small challenges 
 instead of in a repo for future use or to share with others.
 
 Overall its a pretty exciting idea, and can really help to stay current in topics you don't use everyday. However it
  shouldn't replace actual projects, even those that are just for fun.
