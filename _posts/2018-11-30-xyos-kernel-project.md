# XyOX Kernel

I have always had an interest in low level development. The thought of writing an OS kernel, or even working on an existing one, has always intrigued me. During foray into working on the Linux kernel I realized how complex a kernel actually was. It was hard to even know where to start. Putoff by the complexity I mostly abandoned the idea.

Recently I ran across an artical on creating a very simple kernel, which was really eye-opening for me. It seemed like there was no way this thing could work, but yet it did. At that point I decided to create one myself, mostly for fun and to learn how software operates at such a low level.

Although the topics are pretty dense, there are some great resources that help. The [wiki pages at OSDev.org](https://wiki.osdev.org/Main_Page) are invaluable. Also [https://arjunsreedharan.org/post/82710718100/kernels-101-lets-write-a-kernel](https://arjunsreedharan.org/post/82710718100/kernels-101-lets-write-a-kernel) was really helpful in a quick getting started example. And as always, stack exchange!

Checkout what I have so far on my [XyOS Github Repo](https://github.com/emersonmde/xyos). I'm always open to suggestions, help, and ideas.
