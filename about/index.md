## Overview
I'm a 28 year old Software Developer, single father, and technology enthusiast. The center of my world is my daughter, Lillian. I'm also a huge proponent of science and education. I love to learn, discover new facts, and investigate how things work.

## Education
I graduated from a vocational technical high school, **Howard High School of Technology**, in 2008. My vocation was Computer Network Administration Program wherein I also received my **A+**, **Network+**, and **MCP** certifications. A large portion of my technical background was self taught. I have always loved reading up on how things work and through that curiousity I learned many valuable skills.

## Work
### Amazon
I've been working at Amazon for the past 5 years now. Although I've heald many jobs while at Amazon, currently I'm a software developer at one of their fulfillment centers. Being at Amazon has offered a unique view of software development tools and technologies used for applications internally and externally (on AWS).

While I was working as an IT Technican at Amazon, I started learning about the internal development tools mostly through trial and experimentation. I was able to move into a role as an internal web developer in 2017. These days I mostly work with Ruby on Rails websites or internal services. I use these tools to solve problems and help others perform their jobs more efficiently.

### HostMySite
In 2007 I started working at HostMySite (now Hosting.com) as an Infrastructure Technican. I was one of the datacenter technicans who were responsible for server administration, troubleshooting, and hardware builds. While adminstering many Windows/Linux/BSD servers I was able to learn the basics of LAMP sites, in which I discovered my passion for software development.

I was able to move to the Storage Operations team, which presented a new set of challenges. I was mainly responsible for the backup solutions for thousands of servers and the management of the SAN storage solutions. A large part of the job was auditing backup jobs and rerunning failed backups. I was able write scripts that largely automated my job in which I discovered the breadth and power of software development.
